Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. 
We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 
In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. 

How old would you be if you were a dog:

1) The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
2) Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
